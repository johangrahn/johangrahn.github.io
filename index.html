        Okay, since a lot of people over at Podsnack Slack where starting to write according to the challenge <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">100DaysToOffload</a>, I thought that, I can do this aswell! :)
      </p>

      <p>I have really struggled with writing stuff online since I doesn't feel like I have something to contribute to the masses of Bloggers, Influencers, Tech Writers and others. And on top of that I can't spell for shit :) But people say that, with practice you can learn anything so let's get out of that comfort zone then :)</p>
