      <p>When I accepted this writing challenge to write every day, my brain immediately started to thing about all the things that was needed: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Scalability:</b> How can I enable caching?</li>
        <li><b>Headless CMS:</b> How can I change the editor without changing the underlying backend?</li>
        <li><b>Databases and ORM:</b> If I want to change to another database, which ORM should I use to make that as seamless as possible?</li>
        <li><b>Edge-workers:</b> To be able to serve the content all around the world without latency</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After thinking about this for a couple of hours, I realized that I can't do this project, it is just too complex!</p>
      <p>Evetually, after talking to a lot of people about this I realized that I have forgotten the most basic rule of developing software (or other things aswell): <b>KISS</b> (Keep It Simple Stupid). So, after that relalisation, the following stack is currently used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub hosting the full site</li>
        <li>Use only BASIC HTML syntax, nothing else, no Tailwind, no SCSS, no &lt;insert all iterations of all JS frameworks&gt;.</li>
        <li>No server-side rendering</li>
      </ul>

      Because, in the end, content is all that matters to the reader :)

        Okay, since a lot of people over at Podsnack Slack where starting to write according to the challenge <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">100DaysToOffload</a>, I thought that, I can do this aswell! :)
      </p>
      <p>I have really struggled with writing stuff online since I doesn't feel like I have something to contribute to the masses of Bloggers, Influencers, Tech Writers and others. And on top of that I can't spell for shit :) But people say that, with practice you can learn anything so let's get out of that comfort zone then :)</p>
