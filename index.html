      <h3><a href="#body-and-mind">#6 - Body and mind</a></h3>
      <p>Many times during the day I look at myself and I don’t like what I see. </p>
      <p>I know that I'm a good person and I know that in my heart my decisions are pure.</p>
      <p>My problem is that I feel that I can do way better. That I can be better.</p>
      <p>One off this is being accountable for my mind and body. I know that my body needs more attention. Both in
        training
        and in relaxation. I want to feel my muscles and joints. I want to feel my entire body being just one machine
        striving towards a goal.
      </p>
      <p>What is my first goal? What is the first thing I want to achieve? 10 000 steps each day? According to swedish
        research:</p>
      <blockquote>Forskningen säger att <b>minst 7 000 steg</b> motsvarar den allmänna rekommendationen om fysisk
        aktivitet
        som
        Världshälsoorganisationen står bakom, säger Eva Jansson, professor emerita vid institutionen för
        laboratoriemedicin, Karolinska Institutet.
      </blockquote>

      <p>So, I'm going to start with the goal to do 8 000 steps each day to begin with and report my progress.</p>

      <h3><a href="#prioritization">#5 - How-to juggle everything in your life</a></h3>
      <p>One thing that i'm still learning is to properly prioritize between everything that is happeing around me.
      </p>
      <p>There is a lot of techniques if you start to google it like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Eisenhower matrix</li>
        <li>Eat the frog</li>
        <li>Pomodoro</li>
        <li>etc...</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I have tried every one and after about maybe 5 years I have realized that there is no proper solution to this
        since it
        depends on the situtation, energy level, external factors and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I have a lot of mental resistance (going to write about it in another post in the future) it is really
        hard to get the mind to focus on the thing that needs my undivided attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a lot of goals and dreams in my head, but they always get overrun by the decisions that we face every
        morning. You can think thoose decisions are of the calibur "<b>Should I take this job oppertunity or continue
          with my old one?</b>" but it is not. My level is around "<b>Should I take cererials or porage to
          breakfast?</b>" and those can drain me so that rest of the day I have low energy to deal with the bigger
        decisions that happens to the family or work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people that I talk to about this just says, "Well, just pick one!", but that is exacly the problem. I
        can't pick between them, and it is damn fustrating to have that struggle on every decision daily. The same
        goes into things like "Should I use ExpressJS or NextJS for this new project that I want to build"?
      </p>
      <p>Bottom line is: I'm not lazy, I just struggle with other things that "normal" people don't.</p>

      <h3><a href="#javascript-standards">#4 - How-to not standard</a></h3>
      <p>Apperantly there is 2 standards when it comes to importing stuff in NodeJS</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <pre><code>const bla = require("file.js");</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre><code>import bla from "file.js";</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>And it doesn't seem like the community can come to decision on which one to use. And then we come to the
        lovely
        statement of "it depends" :(</p>

      <p>This is the type of things that grinds my gears :)</p>

      <h3><a href="#emacs">#3 - Working with Emacs</a></h3>
      <p>As many of you knows, I use Emacs as my daily driver for all programming related tasks. I really have tried
        to
        like VSCode, Vim and others but in the end, Emacs is just my cup of tea.</p>
      <p> Packages that I can't live without in my setup (not in any order of preference):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>magit</li>
        <li>eglot</li>
        <li>emmet</li>
        <li>yafolding</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Seeing is believing so here it is:</p>

      <h3><a href="#best-solution">#2 - The BEST solution</a></h3>
      <p>When I accepted this writing challenge to write every day, my brain immediately started to thing about all
        the
        things that was needed: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Scalability:</b> How can I enable caching?</li>
        <li><b>Headless CMS:</b> How can I change the editor without changing the underlying backend?</li>
        <li><b>Databases and ORM:</b> If I want to change to another database, which ORM should I use to make that as
          seamless as possible?</li>
        <li><b>Edge-workers:</b> To be able to serve the content all around the world without latency</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After thinking about this for a couple of hours, I realized that I can't do this project, it is just too
        complex!</p>
      <p>Evetually, after talking to a lot of people about this I realized that I have forgotten the most basic rule
        of
        developing software (or other things aswell): <b>KISS</b> (Keep It Simple Stupid). So, after that
        relalisation,
        the following stack is currently used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub hosting the full site</li>
        <li>Use only BASIC HTML syntax, nothing else, no Tailwind, no SCSS, no &lt;insert all iterations of all JS
          frameworks&gt;.</li>
        <li>No server-side rendering</li>
      </ul>

      Because, in the end, content is all that matters to the reader :)

      <h3><a href="#initial-commit">#1 - Initial Commit</a></h3>
      <p>
        Okay, since a lot of people over at Podsnack Slack where starting to write according to the challenge <a
          href="https://100daystooffload.com">100DaysToOffload</a>, I thought that, I can do this aswell! :)
      </p>
      <p>I have really struggled with writing stuff online since I doesn't feel like I have something to contribute to
        the masses of Bloggers, Influencers, Tech Writers and others. And on top of that I can't spell for shit :) But
        people say that, with practice you can learn anything so let's get out of that comfort zone then :)</p>
